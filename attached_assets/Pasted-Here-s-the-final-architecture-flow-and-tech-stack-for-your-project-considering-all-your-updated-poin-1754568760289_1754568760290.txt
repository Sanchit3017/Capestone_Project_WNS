Here's the final architecture flow and tech stack for your project considering all your updated points:

‚úÖ Final Architecture Flow

üì¶ Step-by-Step Flow (Simplified):

1. 

Frontend (React or Next.js)

User selects and uploads either a single file or a folder (containing 3‚Äì6 interdependent files).

Files are uploaded directly to S3 using a pre-signed URL from the backend.


2. 

S3 Bucket

Stores uploaded files temporarily (with lifecycle policy to auto-delete).

On file/folder upload, a Lambda function is triggered.


3. 

AWS Lambda

Triggered by the S3 upload.

It processes and extracts necessary metadata.

Passes the folder content to the FastAPI backend on ECS for review generation.


4. 

FastAPI Backend (Dockerized) running on ECS (Fargate)

Retrieves uploaded files from S3 using the file/folder path.

Sends them to Amazon Bedrock for analysis (e.g., Claude or Titan model).

Applies logic to generate a review (e.g., missing arguments in helper files, file structure inconsistencies).


5. 

Amazon Bedrock

Takes file contents and generates intelligent feedback.

Returns insights/errors/suggestions.


6. 

FastAPI Backend

Processes and formats the review.

Sends it back to the frontend as response to the original request.


7. 

Frontend

Displays the review to the user.

No data is stored persistently (fully stateless/ephemeral).


üß± Tech Stack ‚Äì and What It‚Äôs Used For

Tech

Purpose

React / Next.js

Frontend to upload files, show reviews

Amazon S3

Temporary storage for uploaded files/folders

Lifecycle Policy

Auto-delete S3 files after a short TTL

AWS Lambda

Triggered on upload; invokes backend with file metadata

FastAPI

Main backend API (Dockerized)

Amazon ECS (Fargate)

Runs FastAPI backend in containers

Amazon ECR

Stores FastAPI Docker image for ECS

Amazon Bedrock

Analyzes file contents and gives review

IAM Roles

Manages permissions across Lambda, S3, ECS, Bedrock

CloudWatch

Logs from Lambda and ECS for debugging
